# Bhikar Savkar

Bhikar Savkar is a very simple card game. It is a game I used to play as a kid with my sister. The idea is simple, you shuffle and pick two cards. The one with the higher position in the hierarchy wins the round. If you reach a score of 32 before the CPU, you win.

This is the first iOS app I've made to teach myself a little Swift. Enjoy!
